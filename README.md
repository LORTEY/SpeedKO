# SpeedKO
KOReader plugin for speed reading

Current Progress
Trying to make the pointer work on pdf. Oh wow my first like ona repository. I am so excited!ðŸ¥³. Sorry for slacking off a bit but I will return to this project as soon as I can.
Today the sixth iteration of the idea how to make it work failed miserably i have last one approach to try.
To anyone crazy enough to install it now
copy the speedko.koplugin directory to koreader/plugins/directory
