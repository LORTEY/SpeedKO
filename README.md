Current Progress
Trying to make the pointer work on pdf. Oh wow my first like on a repository. I am so excited!ðŸ¥³. Sorry for slacking off a bit but I will return to this project as soon as I can.

Progress:
*Today the sixth iteration of the idea how to make it work failed miserably i have last one approach to try.
*The idea kinda works but it needs a bit of polishing.
