Current Progress
Trying to make the pointer work on pdf. Oh wow my first like on a repository. I am so excited!ðŸ¥³. Sorry for slacking off a bit but I will return to this project as soon as I can.

Progress:

* Today the sixth iteration of the idea how to make it work failed miserably i have last one approach to try.
* The idea kinda works but it needs a bit of polishing..

Update:
Currently learning C. After i learn it I will be able to understand the backend better especially the CreDocument implementation that koreader uses. Possibly then I will be able to fix this mistake with xPointerles file types like pdf. Currently pointer function works on Epub, txt, html, markdown and probably other dile types. Sorry I have been feeling burned out for some time now. Will try to do something with this project someday.
